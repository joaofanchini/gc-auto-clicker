# Goals
These scripts allow you to automate the click of the **Enter** key, helping to increase the level of necklaces for example, in Grand Chase Classic.

# How to use
Open Grand Chase and open the window where you upgrade your necklaces. Then start the _autoclicker.py_ script and if you want to know if the **Enter** key is being pressed, just open another terminal and run the _key-monitor.py_ script.

To use open a terminal and execute:

* Autoclicker
````sh
  python autoclicker.py
````
* Monitor
````sh
  python key-monitor.py
````

Note: You must leave the necklaces window open and selected for this script to work.

# Prerequisites
* Python 3.12.1
* Pynput 1.7.6 (installed with pip)
