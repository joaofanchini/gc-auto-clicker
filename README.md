# Goals
These scripts allow you to automate the click of the **Enter** key, helping to increase the level of necklaces for example, in Grand Chase Classic.

# How to use
Open Grand Chase and open the window where you upgrade your necklaces. Then start the autoclicker.py script and if you want to know if the Enter key is being pressed, just open another terminal and run the key-monitor.py script.
Note: You must leave the necklaces window open and selected for this script to work.
